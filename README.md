# Weather App

Programming together in pairs to build a weather dashboard that tells today's weather and temperature using a public weather API.

## The problem

Fetching real time data through API end points. Problem we encountered included fetching data from the API's to display the information. Making it responsive on website, mobile and tablet. Tools, team work, discussions, google, stackOverflow. If we had more time we would add multiple cities and more styling in CSS.
